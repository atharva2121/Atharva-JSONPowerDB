## Title : - "Automatic Result Generator System"
This one is my mini project called "Automatic Result Generator System" in which, html is used for front end , javascript for backend and JsonPowerDB for database management.
It's nothing but the user interface where student enters his/her common details such as Name, Student Id, email Id and Date of birth. As this is the result generating system, one has to enter his/her marks of respective subjects. After entering all necessary details, there are 4 buttons available for student such as, Total marks, Percentages, Save the details and Show my details. 
Functionalities of these buttons are : 
1. Total Marks - Shows total marks out off 500 of that particular student.   
2. Percentages - Displays a message that whether that particular student passed or failed according to passing criteria and shows percentages of that particular student.
3. Save the Details - Saves the details entered by student in database using JsonPowerDB.
4. Show my details - Shows the details of that student by fetching the same from database.
### The main focus of this project has been on How to use JPDB for CRUD operations!

## Now let's see about JsonPowerDB:
JsonPowerDB is a Real-time, High Performance, Lightweight and Simple to Use, Rest API based Multi-mode DBMS. JsonPowerDB has ready to use API for Json document DB, RDBMS, Key-value DB, GeoSpatial DB and Time Series DB functionality. JPDB supports and advocates for true serverless and pluggable API development.
### Benefits of using JsonPowerDB
1. Simplest way to retrieve data in a JSON format.
2. Schema-free, Simple to use, Nimble and In-Memory database.
3. It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
4. It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
5. It helps developers in faster coding, in-turn reduces development cost.
